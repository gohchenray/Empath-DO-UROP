# Empath-DO-UROP
This repository documents the work done on an undegraduate research project entitled Empath-Do, a virtual reality application for phone app developers to test accessibility features via a Meta Quest 3 headset.

# Requirements
Packages 
1. Meta XR All in One SDK https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-all-in-one-sdk-269657
2. Realsense SDK 2.0 https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases
Follow the installation steps as per the user guides. For installing Realsense SDK, make sure test scenes provided can be run.  

Others  
As Meta does not allow access to the Quest 3's camera feed, an Intel Realsense D435i depth camera is attached to the front of the headset and image data streamed to Unity via Unity Link cable.
